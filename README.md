# AI Papers of The Week

As a researcher, I frequently read AI papers and am trying to create this repository to record some highlighted AI papers that I read each week.

Here is the weekly series:

| 1) **ReFT: Representation Finetuning for Language Models** - The paper introduces Representation Finetuning (ReFT) methods, particularly focusing on Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), which modifies frozen base models by targeting task-specific interventions in hidden representations. LoReFT stands out for its efficiency, needing 10 to 50 times fewer parameters than prior methods and consistently surpassing them in performance across various tasks including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, as well as the Alpaca-Eval v1.0 and GLUE benchmarks.   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03592), [Repo] (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft)|
